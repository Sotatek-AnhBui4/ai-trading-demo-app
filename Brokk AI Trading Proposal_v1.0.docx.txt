AI Trading Proposal 21st October 2025
I. GENERAL INTRODUCTION
The cryptocurrency trading market requires sophisticated tools that combine real-time data analysis, AI-driven insights, and robust risk management. This PoC aims to validate the core concepts of an AI-powered trading system that:
* Converts market data and sentiment into actionable trading signals
* Creates goal-based trading plans (e.g., "+5% return in 60 days")
* Enforces risk management through automated guardrails
* Provides full transparency and explainability for every decision
II. PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION
The system is divided into three distinct phases. The first phase includes the PoC(Proof of Concept) version which has  core features with well-defined development requirements. These features represent the fundamental functionality of the system, which has been clearly outlined. The second phase encompasses advanced future-oriented features, which are designed to add enhanced capabilities as the system evolves. Finally, the third phase focuses on mobile application and advanced optimization to improve the quality of system


Phase 1 (PoC):
* 2 assets: BTC, ETH, 2 market pairs: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
* Simplified goal-based optimization
* Paper trading only (no real money, on staging server)
* Basic AI Agent for trading
* Basic explainability (SHAP/feature importance)
* Web dashboard for signal viewing and goal creation
Phase 2:
* Real money trading(on TCX production server)
* Advanced for risk control
* Advanced for AI Agent(More social media sentiments)
* Advanced for Execution
* Post-trade surveillance
Phase 3:
* More assets, more exchanges
* Mobile application
* Advanced optimization (More than 100 simulations: depends on supported number of token and number of market pair)
* Advanced warning and tracking


PHASE 1 (PoC)
Prerequisite
* Only for spot trading
* No promise of returns
* Only one centralized exchange (assumption: TCX staging server)
* No real money, only paper trading only, on staging server(not production server)
* No admin control, user can config the rule-based by themself


Note: Chúng tôi gợi ý ra những tính năng cho bản PoC như này bởi vì 
+ Trước khi chạy thật với tiền thật, cần ưu tiên kiểm chứng tính đúng đắn và độ khả thi ở môi trường staging
+ Các tính năng này chúng tôi đánh giá là cơ bản cho một flow khi ứng dụng công cụ AI trading vào giao dịch
+ Các giới hạn về số lượng token, market pair để đơn giản hóa các tính năng, sớm hoàn thiện hơn để đưa vào sử dụng thử
+ Thay vì chạy thử với các sàn giao dịch bên ngoài, thì chúng tôi recommend cho việc sử dụng TCX staging server để làm sàn dùng thử, dễ control và monitor công cụ AI trading hơn
1. Authentication
* Login/Signup/Logout user: Common as usual
2. User profile
* After signup successfully, showing the user information
3. AI trading rules-based configuration
* Risk Control: 
   * Position limit: maximum 20% capital in 1 coin (per-asset cap), maximum 40% capital in 1 sector (sector cap allowed)
   * Risk Limit: Maximum VaR(Value at Risk): 2%/day
   * Creating multiple risk control levels
* AI Agent (Running in background):
   * Create AI Agent for threshold analysis, price increase probability and reliability calculation (assumption: AI Agent will be created by Claude/GPT API service)
   * AI threshold analysis: AI will analyze and indicate the feasible threshold (E.g.: 60%)
   * Calculate the probability of price increase: condition > threshold
   * Calculate the reliability: condition > threshold
   * Source: sentiment surge (Fear, greed: alternative.me, NO social media), whale inflows (designated hard-coded wallet IDs -> crawler from those wallets), market data (on-chain data, volume)
   * Only apply for STRONG BUY
   * Dashboard for signal viewing and the AI analysis
* Create goal plan: 
   * Input must-have:
      * Initial capital (E.g. $10,000)
      * Profit target (E.g. +5%)
      * Time (E.g. 60 days)
      * Risk level (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
      * Constraints (Risk Control) 
4. Exchange Integration & Execution
* Exchange integration: on TCX staging server, integrate with private/public APIs
   * Exchange linking: authentication, token for private API
   * Show balance information
   * Market pair integration: Limit market pairs based on these 2 tokens BTC, ETH and 2 market pairs BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT
* Execution:
   * Pre-executing:
      * Check user profile information before trading
      * Check KYC/AML before placing an order
   * In-executing: TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) - divided equally over 60 minutes
      * Conditions:
         * Allow partial filling
         * Timeout 5 minutes per order
         * Split large orders to reduce price impact
   * Post-executing:
      * Clearly explain why the purchase (Basic explainability)
5. Tracking
* History:
   * Balance history
   * Order history
   * Trade history
* Tracker: on-track or behind of target


PHASE 2
Prerequisite
* Only for spot trading
* No promise of returns
* Only one centralized exchange (assumption: TCX production server)
* Real money trading
1. System Logging
* Snapshot of data at the time of decision
* Output of AI Agent decision
* Decision reason
* Order details (price, volume, time)
* Fills result (how much filled, how much price)
* Post-trade PnL
* Send notification to user
2. Advanced for Risk Control
* Position Limits:
   * Blacklist
   * Whitelist
* Risk Limits:
   * Maximum drawdown: 3%
   * Maximum slippage: 0.25%/order
* Leverage and perpetual future (Out of scope)
   * On/Off leverage
   * One/Off futures/perpetuals
* Pause around the event:
   * Pause 10-15 minutes before/after CPI announcement
   * Pause 30 minutes before/after Fed meeting (FOMC)
* Circuit breaker:
   * Automatically sell out stablecoin (USDC) when:
      * Drawdown reach 3%
   * Notify emergency for users
3. Advanced AI Agent
* More social media sentiments(Twitter, Reddit)
* AI Agent apply for STRONG SELL
4. Advanced Execution
* VWAP (Volume-Weighted) - theo khối lượng
* Smart routing - chọn sàn có giá tốt nhất
5. Post-trade surveillance
* Continuous monitoring after the transaction:
   * Abnormal PnL: => Warning
   * Wash trading (self-buying and self-selling) => flag
   * Too much focus on 1 coin => warning
   * Actual and expected slippage => evaluate execution quality


PHASE 3
1. More assets, more exchanges
2. Mobile application
3. Advanced optimization 
* More than supported number of tokens
* More than supported number of trading pair
4. Advanced warning
* No Guaranteed Profits
* Results are Probable, Not Certain
* May Lose Money
* Not Financial Advice
5. Advanced tracking:
* If behind then suggest adjustment
* If adjustment INCREASES RISK -> must be approved by user
6. Admin Control

VII. WORK MODEL, COST, AND SCHEDULE
1. Work Model 
* The team will work on a T&M contract and use either the Agile/Scrum or Waterfall methodology for development. We recommend using the Agile approach, where the timeline is divided into sprints, each lasting ~2 weeks.
* The team will receive requirements from the customer and handle tasks according to the capabilities of the team members.
* When a task exceeds the team's capabilities (non-technical issues), we will discuss adding or changing team members.
2. Cost and Team Structure
